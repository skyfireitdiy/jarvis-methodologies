  "content": "## Problem Restatement\nHow to create a diagram (e.g., sequence, component, state diagram) to visualize a process, workflow, or system architecture based on a textual description.\n\n## Optimal Solution\n1.  **Analyze the Description**: Carefully read the user's request to identify the key entities (actors, components, classes) and the interactions or relationships between them.\n2.  **Draft the PlantUML Script**: Based on the analysis, write the corresponding PlantUML script that describes the diagram.\n3.  **Generate the Diagram**: Use the `generate_plantuml_diagram` tool to directly convert the PlantUML script content into a diagram image.\n    - **Input**: Provide the script content to the `puml_content` parameter.\n    - **Input (Optional)**: Specify an `output_path` if a specific file name or location is desired.\n4.  **Present the Result**: Inform the user that the diagram has been successfully created and provide the path to the output image file.\n\n## Notes\n- The `generate_plantuml_diagram` tool requires that the `plantuml` command-line utility is installed on the system and available in the PATH. The tool's `check` method can be used to verify this prerequisite.\n- This methodology streamlines the process by using a dedicated tool, avoiding manual file creation and cleanup."
